  This instance is still in the process of bootstrapping itself. You are
  able to log in because your pubkeys are installed, but until the
  bootstrap process is finished some things may not be fully configured.
  If this message is gone from `/etc/motd` it means the bootstrap is done.

Run `tmux` to start a shared session or `tmux attach` to join.

The tmux escape character is control-z, so you can use `C-z d` to detach.

Use the `add-github-user` script to add a public key to this session.

When you are done with this node, run `sudo halt` but make sure you've
pushed all your work as it will be gone when the node halts.
