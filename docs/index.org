** Sharing is Pairing!

sharing.io is a service, inspired by [[https://github.com/technomancy/syme][Syme]], for creating collaborative coding environments.

Each sharing.io instance includes a full kubernetes cluster, a pair-focused text-editor, and a tmate instance.  This lets you work directly inside the cluster and in a shared session.

You can check it out at [[https://pair.sharing.io][pair.sharing.io]]

** Getting Started
To use pair.sharing.io, you must have a github account and be a part of one of the following github organizations:
- [[https://github.com/sharingio][sharingio]]
- [[https://github.com/kubernetes/][kubernetes]]
- [[https://github.com/cncf][cncf]]

After logging in with your github account, you will see the options "New" and "All".  New lets you create a new sharing instance.  "All" lists all the instances you've created, or that have been shared with you.
