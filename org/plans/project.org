#+TITLE: Project plan

* Structure

** Syme / frontend + OAuth
*** Flow
- go to pairing.caring and put in a repo
- click launch and be brought to github authentication
- upon authentication be brought to project page
- project page is for deploying machine to packet
  - do you want kubernetes or just a box?
  - do you have a sharing.io repo with yr preferred setup?
    - if not, use our default setup
- fill out form and press launch
- box is created on packet, potentially cluster is setup
- ssh key join code is returned to screen for you to copy/paste
*** Unknowns
- how the kickoff page should be structured: eg. what info we need to know from them.
- process for seeing if they have a sharing.io repo
** Cluster-API-Manager
*** flow
- post to create a cluster on Packet
- get to see device and status
  - IP address
  - kubeconfig
  - tmate
    - ssh
    - https
- get all devices
- delete to ... delete
*** Notes
- only talked to by Syme
- for Kubernets Cluster, make use of https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api
- for Plain boxes, make use of https://github.com/packethost/packngo
*** Considerations
- no Packet API key should be available
- no Node access should be available
  - disallow ~hostPath~
- no Packet CSI PVs should be able to be claimed
- hostNetworking should not be allowed
